```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
#import ssl

# This handler says MEOW to all GET requests
class MeowHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write("MEOW!".encode("utf-8"))

server_address = ('localhost', 4443)
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, MeowHandler)
#httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, keyfile='selfsigned.key', certfile='selfsigned.crt', server_side=True)
try:
    httpd.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    httpd.server_close()
```

tcpdump on **localhost** (`-i lo0`) **port 4443**, **show full packets** (`-s 0`)

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i lo0 -s 0 tcp port 4443 -w localhost-http.pcap
```

https://localhost:4433?query=something

We can see the request! And the response!

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -out selfsigned.crt -nodes -keyout selfsigned.key -subj /O=Recurse/CN=localhost
man req
```

base64-encoding of a ASN.1-formatted file (similar in concept to JSON)
```bash
openssl asn1parse -i -in mysterious_file.pem
```

more helpful output format (look for `notBefore`, `notAfter`)
```bash
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout
man x509
```

wireshark --version
check GnuTLS (SSL decryption support)

sudo tcpdump -i any -s 0 port 4433 -w localhost.pcap
sudo tcpdump -n port 1060 -i lo â€“X
https://localhost:4433/
^C

4433 -> HTTP settings

Open the capture file in wireshark and confirm you see something similar to the walkthrough. If all you see are TCP entries (no HTTP or SSL), and your traffic is on a non-standard port, add that port to HTTP and SSL settings.
Look at the handshake pattern: rsa-only, or DH.




this should be the public key + issuer statement signed by issuer's private key
is this self-signed? how do I tell the two parts apart?
